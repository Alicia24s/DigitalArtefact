- Type out answer comments you dont need them

- you need more questions cause the score doesn't reflect 

- Add extensive comments to explain stuff --> have an opening comment at the top

- testing to see where it breaks

- extensive try catch blocks and error handling

- Make the code have a better style and insert comments at the top of each file

- start writing report
