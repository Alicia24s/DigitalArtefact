# To do (SEE Architecture sheet)

## Primary things to do (Do for one option first and test to see if it works then copy for the other 4)

- Create classes for the Each option - Beginner, Intermediate, Advance for each and fill out the qs

- Complete logic of AnswerManager - first get right/wrong answer functions for switch statements --> find out whether or not it will work if you dont initialise the variables

- Create a class that stores the user's answers 

- Create a class that calculates by getting scores from users answers (Will need normal distribution - matrixes) - Have calculation functions with parameters/constructors (Idek what i mean but yk the functions that take an input into the parameters and then return a result from a calculation that is inside said function? Yh you need to do that )

- Make sure this works and at the end user gets some sort of score


## Secondary things to do

- Use getters and setters on the personalinfo.java --> move the personal info from TestLogic.java and then call the same information from personalinfo.java as something that is encrypted (ask about how you would do this)

- Give access modifiers (private, public, protected) to your object initialisers --> Find out what needs to be what and where it needs to be for this to make sense

- Find a way to display a point on a horizontal scale(Bar) of where the Questionnaire taker has ranked
