## To do (SEE Architecture sheet)

- Create classes for the Each option - Beginner, Intermediate, Advance for each andn fill out the qs

- Complete logic of AnswerManager

- Create a class that stores the user's answers 

- Create a class that calculates by getting scores from users answers (Will need normal distribution - matrixes)

- Use getters and setters on the personalinfo.java --> move the personal info from TestLogic.java and then call the same information from personalinfo.java as something that is encrypted (ask about how you would do this)

- Give access modifiers (private, public, protected) to your object initialisers --> Find out what needs to be what and where it needs to be for this to make sense

- Have calculation functions with parameters/constructors (Idek what i mean but yk the functions that take an input into the parameters and then return a result from a calculation that is inside said function? Yh you need to do that )
