## Constructor rules

- Must have same name of class

- Can never have a return type (not even void)

- They can have NO parameters


## Encapsulation

The following are:
- Getters: Read access --> read access to private variables
- Setters: Write access --> allows us to modify private variables

## 16/4/24 -- Null checking and Inheritance

- cover null checking on w3 schools


- You can use extends instead of inheritance for subclasses of a superclass --> you could have O1-4_BEG/INT/ADV extend the AnswerManagwer.java class

- When you inherit from the superclass the variables are inherited also

- Options Pathways should extend testLogic class so that you can use that same scanner in the parameters :)

- Note - When you're done write out all your classes with all the methods they have and see if you can create one method that can be called --> See picture taken from this lecture in your camera roll
